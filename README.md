Introduction
The way we travel has evolved as a result of digital technology, which has made flight and trip planning simpler. Finding the greatest flight deals can still be difficult for those who have flexible trip dates. The majority of booking apps make it difficult to compare costs between different days. This issue is intended to be resolved by our newest product, the Flexible Date Explorer, which assists consumers in finding the cheapest flights quickly.
Problem Definition
 Many flight booking apps do not support people who can travel on any day and want the cheapest flights. Finding the best prices frequently requires users to check a large number of dates, which is time-customers. Furthermore, users are unable to make the best decisions because these apps are unable to predict when prices may rise or fall. This leads to a difficult and potentially costly flight booking experience.
Suggested solution 
The Flexible Date Explorer will improve the booking experience by adding several helpful tools to the app:
•	Interactive Price Calendar: This calendar makes it simple to find the days that are the cheapest to fly by displaying the costs of flights on various days.
•	Price Trends Graph: This graphic assists customers in selecting the ideal time to purchase tickets by displaying historical and future prices.
•	Destination Flexibility: The software will recommend less expensive options for both routes and dates for users who are willing to visit other locations.
•	Real-time Alerts: When prices for the dates or locations they have selected decrease, users can receive notifications.
•	Advanced Predictive Analytics: The app will use machine learning to evaluate historical pricing data in order to predict future price changes. Based on these predictions, users will be advised to book now or later.
